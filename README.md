# Introduction

These are some scripts I have written in Perl during my Unix and Scripting course.

## Program

The program folder contains a Perl script that provides a menu-driven program for the user to perform several operations on a data file named `datafile`. The user is able to list the file records alphabetically or reverse alphabetically by first or last name, search by last name and search by birthday month or year.

## Scripts

The scripts folder contains general scripts that were meant to familiarize myself with Perl's syntax.
